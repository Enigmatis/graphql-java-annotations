# Governance

- Maintainers meet monthly to triage issues and PRs.
- Due to limited time, we ask issue reporters to propose fixes via PR when possible.
- Decisions are made by lazy consensus among maintainers; in case of disagreement, majority vote among maintainers.
- Security issues: follow SECURITY.md.
- Release cadence: as needed when changes accumulate.
