# Contributing to graphql-java-annotations

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

Because maintainer time is limited, we prioritize contributions that come with a proposed fix. If you open an issue, please consider also opening a PR. We’re happy to guide you.

## Ways to help
- Report bugs with a minimal reproduction (see issue template)
- Improve documentation and examples
- Add tests for uncovered areas
- Small refactors and build improvements

## Coding guidelines
- Follow existing style and conventions
- Include unit tests for new behavior
- Keep public API changes minimal; discuss major changes first in an issue

## PR process
1. Open an issue or draft PR to discuss non-trivial changes
2. Keep PRs small and focused
3. Ensure tests are passing
4. One maintainer approval is typically sufficient; we run monthly triage

## Commit messages
- Clear and concise; reference issues like: “Fix: X (#123)”

## Release process
- See RELEASE.md

## Community conduct
- See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
